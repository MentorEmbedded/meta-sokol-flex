# OpenEmbedded/Yocto layers for Flex OS

This repository holds the layers needed by our Yocto builds of Flex OS.
Currently the Flex OS layers are:

- meta-flex-distro: The Flex OS distribution layer
- meta-flex-support: Support files for Flex OS
- meta-flex-staging: Our staging area for bits which belong upstream
- meta-flex-common: Common files amongst the layers of this repository

See the individual layer readmes for additional detail and contribution
information.
