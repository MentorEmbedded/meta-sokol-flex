# OpenEmbedded/Yocto layers for Sokol Flex OS

This repository holds the layers needed by our Yocto builds of Sokol Flex OS. At
this time there are three such layers:

- meta-sokol-flex-distro: The Sokol Flex OS distribution layer
- meta-sokol-flex-support: Support files for Sokol Flex OS
- meta-sokol-flex-staging: Our staging area for bits which belong upstream
- meta-sokol-flex-common: Common files amongst the layers of this repository

See the individual layer readmes for additional detail and contribution
information.
