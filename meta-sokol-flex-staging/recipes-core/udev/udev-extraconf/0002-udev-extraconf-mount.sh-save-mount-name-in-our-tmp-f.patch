Subject: [PATCH 2/3] udev-extraconf/mount.sh: save mount name in our tmp file
 cache

Doing this will allow to fetch the exact name created by the
auto-mounter during the remove action where depending on the
scenario utilities such as the blkid might not be usable due
to actual device not being present on the system.
